# RISC-V_HDP

**W-1:**  Understanding how a C program is compiled using various compilers with the help of the Godbolt platform.

**W-2:** Introduction to RISC-V ISA Exploring the RISC-V ISA architecture.Understanding how microarchitecture is defined based on assembly instructions of a program and measuring CPU performance.

**W-3** Selecting an application, write a C code demonstrating its functionality, and subsequently include inline assembly code within the same file to access hardware resources.

**W-4** Generating the Optimised RTL logic specific to the C program and testbench using ChipCron tool. GPIO configuration and functional simulation using UART.

**W-5** GLS Simulation and synthesis of the generated RTL. Synthesis is performed using the yosys tool and simulation using iverilog. Bypassing UART.
