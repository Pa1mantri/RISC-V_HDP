## Showing the assembly code differences for various C programs 

Using [https://godbolt.org/] to display the assembly code of a C Program using different compilers. 

The First C code is that of a counter. In the image below, we can find the difference in the assembly codes generated by two different compilers RISC-V and X86.

We can also find the difference in the number of instructions used in the assembly code's of the two compilers.

The colors in the C code and the assembly language correspond to their respective code and assembly language instructions for that specific code.
