## Showing the assembly code differences for various C programs 

Using https://godbolt.org/ to display the assembly code of a C Program using different compilers. 

The First C code is that of a counter. In the image below, we can find the difference in the assembly codes generated by two different compilers RISC-V and X86.

The colors in the C code and the assembly language correspond to their respective code and assembly language instructions for that specific code.

We can also find the difference in the number of instructions used in the assembly code's of the two compilers.
